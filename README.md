# CodeAlpha_Disease-prediction-from-medical-data

This is a **machine learning project** built as part of my **Code Alpha internship**, aimed at predicting diseases based on patient data such as age, symptoms, and medical history. The project demonstrates the full ML workflow: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Project Overview
The **Disease Prediction Model** uses a dataset of patient information to predict the likelihood of specific diseases. It is designed to be simple, easy to use, and replicable for anyone learning machine learning during internships or personal projects.

**Objectives:**
- Predict potential diseases based on patient input.
- Provide a hands-on example of ML workflow for internships.
- Show integration of Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn in real applications.

---

## Features
- Predicts diseases from structured medical data.
- Handles missing data and normalizes inputs automatically.
- Easy to retrain the model with new or updated datasets.
- Outputs predictions with probability scores for better insight.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – data handling and preprocessing
- **Scikit-learn** – machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – optional visualizations
- **Joblib / Pickle** – saving and loading trained models
- **GitHub Codespaces / Colab** – development environment
